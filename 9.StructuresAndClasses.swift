// 9. Structures and Classes
// What is the difference between structures and classes?
//  Structures are value types, while classes are reference types.
// So, when you assign a structure to a new constant or variable, you get a copy of the original value.
// However, when you assign a class to a new constant or variable, you get a reference to the original value.
